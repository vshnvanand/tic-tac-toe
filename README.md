# tic-tac-toe
This is practice repo where we practice devops methodologies in the following manner 
1. First we will clone the basic files ie. HTML, game.py and requrements.txt
2. After fetching the files what we won't run them manully on our device like python game.py instead we will make a docker container and image to run it in them.
# It will be better if your device won't have any python interpreter pre install so that you can practice directly in docker.
4.
